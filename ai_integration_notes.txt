This file documents the AI integration added to app.py.

- Uses OpenAI Python library if installed and OPENAI_API_KEY provided.
- Sidebar: toggle to enable AI and optional API key input (stored in session state).
- The assistant is instructed to only use provided context and to output a JSON action when it intends to trigger an app action (e.g., {"action":"target_vol","target_vol":0.15}).
- If JSON action detected, app will set st.session_state.ai_action/ai_target_vol and rerun.
- Falls back to the local safe_assistant when OpenAI is not available or API key missing.

Security: do not commit API keys. Use environment variable OPENAI_API_KEY or enter key in the sidebar for local testing.
